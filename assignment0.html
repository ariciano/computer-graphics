			Computer graphics has always been a mystery to me. What are shaders? What are primitives composed of? How do you control light sources and create compelling 3d environments? This lack of understanding has always prevented me from being comfortable creating in 3d environments. I know there is immense power in computer graphics, and I want to learn how to best harness them.

			Additionally, during my undergraduate study in mechanical engineering, part of the curriculum was linear algebra. I understood there were many applications for this field, and I am hoping to better understand matrix mathematics by using computer graphics as a better way to visualize how these transforms function.

			In taking this class, I hope to learn how to create more compelling 2d and 3d environments for the web. I have projects in mind for both 2d and 3d graphics applications that involve interactivity and sound. One is an interactive visualization where users draw shapes and can play the shapes specific sound. In this case I would like to explore how I can map and translate shapes and colors into sounds. I am also interested in creating 3d space environments using real data about our solar system, creating a more human and earthly impression of the size and scale of space.

			I also want to combine webgl with webaudio, my focus this summer working on Tone.js for google summer of code. I want to look into creating physical environments with auditory modeling of governing physics. This could involve physical modeling of collisions, doppler shift, and others.
